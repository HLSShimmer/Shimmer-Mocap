# Shimmer-Mocap
This is a repository that includes SHIMMER kinematics calculation, and compared with the data from mocap.
##Access to the code
Run the main.m file and will get the result.
##Process of This Repository
* Load data from shimmer and mocap.
* Some parameters setting.
* Call SensorKinematics function to get kinematics information from shimmer.
* Filter data from mocap.
* Align the shimmer global frame to mocap frame.
* Ploat result.
